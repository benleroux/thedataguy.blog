2. Install Gatsby with `npm install -g gatsby-cli`.
3. `cd` into the root directory of the cloned repository and run `npm install` to install all site dependencies.
4. Run `gatsby develop` to build and start a local development server.
5. View the site at `localhost:8000`, with graphql endpoint at `localhost:8000/___graphql`

## CI/CD

Pushing code into this repository triggers two GitHub Actions:

1. `Purge Azure CDN`: which clears the Azure CDN cached content via purging
2. `Deploy Website to Azure Storage Account`: which builds the static site with `gatsby build`, and uploads content to an Azure Storage Account - where the site is being hosted.
