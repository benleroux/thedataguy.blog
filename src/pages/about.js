          <h2>Why Data?</h2>
          <p>Like I mentioned on my main page, I live an breath data.</p>
          <p>
            I hated my first Oracle course in school. So much so that I vowed at the time I would
            never become a DBA or have anything to do with databases; I was going to be a "developer" 
            <span role="img" aria-label="sheep">ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</span>. 
            Fast forward a few years and SQL Server 6.5... I wrote my first stored procedure. Let's 
            say, I was hooked. Branching to BI then architecture, I've never looked back.
          </p>
          <p>
            Data fuels organizations. So why not be at the center of it all???
          </p>
          <h2>Why make this blog?</h2>
          <p>
            On a day to day basis, I use Azure services, experience how our client use as well
            and figure out why not share with others what I know and have learned.
          </p>
          <p>
            Simple way to pay it forward. Plus, in some way, I also enjoy it
          </p>
          <h2>Huge shout out to Raki!!!</h2>
          <p>
            I'd like to give a huge shout out to Raki Rahman for introducing me to Gatsby. Gave 
            me a reason to  get off Wordpress and get some coding in.

            Also, kudos for making his site available in GitHub as it allowed me to use it and get
            started faster.
